			Most of us have an idea of what time travel should be like, or atleast how amusing the movies make it look. One of the most accurate descriptions of time travelling was done in the 2014 movie <strong>Interstellar</strong>, where the protagonist, Cooper entered into a black hole, interacted with the higher dimensions and learnt how to communicate with his daughter back on Earth, transmitting data from the black hole in the form of Morse code via gravity to exert a force across the space time fabric(agreed, that was a bit too much). Of course, movie makers generally turn to their creative sides, especially when it comes to topics like time travel, creating characters who travel back generations only to meet their parents or to meet the 'to be' presidents of their countries. I'll try and make this interesting, and yes communicate to you in 'English'.
			Let me point out a few of the topics we'll actually discuss:
		
			<ol>
				<li>Space and Time Dilation</li>
				<li>Singularities</li>
				<li>Lorentz Transformations and the Theory of Relatvity</li>
				<li>General scientific dialect on the space-time</li>
			</ol>

		</h1>

			Gravity is very alluring. It baffled philosophers for centuries, was discovered by Newton, and then re-defined by Einstein.Gravity is the weakest of all the fundamental forces in the universe. However, to fit into relativity, Einstein defined gravity, not as a force, but rather a disturbance in our space time fabric, caused by mass or even by the presence of energy.

			Traditional theories of time were simple. It was assumed to be this infinite stretch, or a line, running infinitely in both directions. Which means, history existed forever, and you inevitably always move in a frontward direction, against your will and wish. 
			This theory had philosphical contradictions, if everything had existed forever, then why do we bring up the arguement of creation, or how does it allow space for creation, if everything had existed forever? Scientifically, why wasnt the universe in this state of thermal equillibrium, where each and every object around us was at the same temperature?
			Isaac Newton did not describe Space and time as one entity, he did say that they operate in the backgrounds of our universe.Of course,not enough to seem plausible.
			I will refrain from going too much into the details of these theories, scientific journals and books are going to help you better. The content here is a self reflection, and more immportantly, open to speculation and discussion.
